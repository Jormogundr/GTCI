# GTCI

This repo contains any notes, solutions, and related files that are part of my work through the educative.io program called "Grokking the Coding Interview".

The course's home page is here: https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview

Solutions are written primarily in C++, or ocassionally Python3.  

Currently, the project is organized from the root by pattern type e.g. 'Sliding Window' and each pattern type will contain:
    - 'examples', containing educative.io's solution to the question
    - 'exercises', containing my attempt at solving the questions posed in the lessons. Not all examples will have a corresponding exercise, as I pick and choose what to try to implement.
